# SimpleBankingSystem

This is going to be the start of my own simple banking system. The goal is for it to be able to perform a few basic operations and read and write data to a database. When it runs, it's going to run an an interface menu that allows that prompts the user to create a card, log into their account, or exit out of the system. When a card is created for a bank, the cards number, pin, id, and balance will be saved in the database. That's pretty much it. It's a work in progress, espicially with school right now, I'm kinda busy.
